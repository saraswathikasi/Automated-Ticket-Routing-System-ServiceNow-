# Automated-Ticket-Routing-System-ServiceNow-
Built a dynamic routing engine for incident tickets using Assignment Rules, Script Includes, and SLA escalation flows. Implemented load balancing among team members and reduced manual triage time by 50%.
The automated ticket routing system is more like assigning multiple problems to multiple persons.
Let's take a example :
    There are n no.of students each with different problems, take them as tickets.
    Here we will create a automation which understands what kind of problem it is, that is used to send problem                automatically to the right helper (Team). It each time picks only one person from team so it won't get overloaded.
    If the helper is slow, tells the manager to speed it up.
Why it's useful:
      Faster Help – No one waits too long for support.
      Fair Workload – Work is shared equally among helpers.
      Smart Alerts – If a problem isn’t solved quickly, it gets escalated.
      Less Manual Work – No need for a human to assign each problem.
